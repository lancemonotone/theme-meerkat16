IMPORTING PARTIALS
These files are needed at the beginning so that we establish all
our mixins, functions, and variables that we'll be using across
the whole project.
*********************/

/*********************
BASE (MOBILE) SIZE
This are the mobile styles. It's what people see on their phones. If
you set a great foundation, you won't need to add too many styles in
the other stylesheets. Remember, keep it light: Speed is Important.

/*********************
LARGER MOBILE DEVICES

larger than an iPhone but smaller than a tablet. Let's call them
tweeners.
*********************/
@media only screen and (min-width: $mobile_portrait) {
  @import "breakpoints/_710up";
}

// end of media query
/*********************
TABLET & SMALLER LAPTOPS
This is the average viewing window. So Desktops, Laptops, and
in general anyone not viewing on a mobile device. Here's where
you can add resource intensive styles.

/*********************
RETINA (2x RESOLUTION DEVICES)

PRINT STYLESHEET
Feel free to customize this. Remember to add things that won't make
sense to print at the bottom. Things like nav, ads, and forms should
be set to display none.
