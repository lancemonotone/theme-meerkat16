# wp-theme-meerkat16
Current Theme for Williams College, fully responsive, utilizing SCSS and Twig/Timber templating engine to separate presentation from logic. I am slowly converting this theme from largely procedural code to a modular class-based model. Presentation files (*.twig), controllers (*.php), styles (*.scss), and UX interactivity (*.js) are placed in modules to allow easy maintenance; each major element of the site is governed by a group of files which share an ID.
